## Getting Started

Please follow the steps below to in order setup and use the resources within the
repo correctly.

1. Ensure you are using **Python 3.8.6**. To check which version you are using, use  the code `python -V` within the console.
2. Although not required, it is best practice to always use a virtual
environment. Use `python -m venv env` within the directory to get a copy of your
existing environment.
3. Install all the required packages using the command
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.
